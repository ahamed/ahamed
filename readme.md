Hello everyone :raised_hands:, I am **Sajeeb Ahamed** a *full stack developer* currently working at [JoomShaper](https://joomshaper.com). I am a big fan of JavaScript specially ES6+ and libraries like `ReactJS`, `VueJS` and `node.js`. For backend, I mostly write *php* code.

Currently, I am creating a open source *php* library named [JsPhp](https://github.com/ahamed/JsPhp). By using this you can write *php* `array, object, string` methods like `JavaScript` way.

I like to help people. I often contribute at [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4610740/sajeeb-ahamed).
